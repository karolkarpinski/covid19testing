This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
covid <- read.csv("covid.csv")
  

library(knitr)
kable(covid, col.names = c("State/Territory", "Positive test results", "Negative test results", "Pending results", "Total tested"))
```
